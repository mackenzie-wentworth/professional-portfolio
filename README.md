## The Task

Assigned by this week's Challenge, I was tasked to build my own portfolio webpage from scratch to present to future employers. The portfolio incorporates advanced CSS skills to include the following items:

* Developer's name and a recent photo or avatar
* Navigation bar with links for sections throughout the portfolio
* Sections to include details about the developer, their work/projects, and contact information
* Links attached to each project that directs the user to the deployed application
* Responsive design accessibility to view the portfolio using different screen sizes and devices based on the user's viewport


## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality for MacKenzie Wentworth's porfolio:
